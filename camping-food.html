    <h1>My Favorite Camping Food:</h1>
    <h2><em>Freeze Dried</em></h2>
    <p>My favorite things to eat when I am camping are things that are easily prepared, that's why I like freeze dried meals, they are easy to make and taste <strong>Great!</strong></p>
    <p>This is an example of the freeze dried food I like when I am camping. <img  src="img/freezedried.jpg"></p>
    <p>The best place I have found to buy freeze dried food is off of <a href="https://amazon.com"> <em>Amazon</em></a></p>
